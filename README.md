# Recurrence Explorer

**Recurrence Explorer** is an interactive Streamlit app that lets you:
- Define any 3-term integer recurrence \(f_{n} = \dots\).
- Choose your modulus (e.g. 101), number of terms, and initial values.
- See a **step-by-step trace** of each computation.
- View a **summary** of which residues appeared and which are missing.
